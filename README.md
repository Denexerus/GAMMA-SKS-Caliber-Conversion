# GAMMA-SKS-Caliber-Conversion

A simple change in the configs so the SKS family has the correct damage when converted to 7.62x54R. I took the liberty to change a couple of things:

1) SKS Molot RPM is 350 (prev 270). Always thought that this gun should be a direct upgrade to grandpa's ol'reliable default SKS, yet for some reason it has 270 RPM.

2) Caliber conversion upgrade changes following rapameters of a gun:
RPM is lowered by 200, mainly because the SKS Tactical has a 600 RPM, so the upgraded version won't go toe-to-toe with the SVDS.
Damage of the gun (hit_power) is increased from 0.58 to 1.1 (this is the main reason why SKS damage sucks after the conversion)
Upgrade cost is 20640 roubles now (x3 the default one)
Other minor gun parameters so it ould be on par with other 7.62R rifles:
fire_distance +100 meters
bullet_speed +120 m/s
hit_impulse is increased to 40
